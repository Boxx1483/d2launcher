First of all I would like to thank the Median XL team for the great work! This little zenity shell script downloads the latest Median XL mod from https://www.median-xl.com and save this file locally. You can simple patch your Diablo II with this script. Also includes Sven's glide wrapper from http://www.svenswrapper.de.
